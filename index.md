### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    The first lab I enjoyed was lab 3, part 1 because of the way we were able to use std::cin to input custom words into a running program. It ended up being a surprising challenge to program the statements correctly, so the format looked natural to the reader.

* Lab 4

    In lab 4, part 2, the familiarity of mathematical conversions was refreshing in the midst of overwhelming programming. Since computers run using numbers, it felt much easier to create a program that dealt with numbers instead of words. It also provided a good opportunity to use newer variables such a double and float. After writing the program, I could clearly see how much time can be saved by writing a simple program.

* Lab 8

    I also liked lab 8, part 1, as it was the first time I used a program to read a seperate file. To be honest, it was overwhelming at first. But, as I got more comfortable with concepts such as arguments and if-statements and asking questions about them, the result was well worth it. The program ended up being very rewarding to see lists of hundreds or thousands of words being sorted through and the program giving me back only palindrome words.
